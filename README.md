When describing software engineering interviews, it’s essential to highlight the key aspects that make them unique. Here are some points to consider:

### Technical Skills Assessment:

- Software engineer interviews often involve assessing technical skills. Have the necessary programming knowledge and problem-solving abilities.
- Whiteboard tests and coding challenges are common components of these interviews. During a whiteboard test, you’ll solve a software problem on a whiteboard or paper, explaining your thought process as you go. Coding tests are usually administered online, where you solve problems within a set time frame1.

### Common Interview Questions:
Familiarize yourself with common software engineer interview questions. Some examples include:

- Programming Languages: Be prepared to discuss the programming languages you’re familiar with. Highlight languages relevant to the job description.
- Project Experience: Describe a recent project, including any obstacles you faced and your contributions to its success.
- Paradigms: Discuss your thoughts on declarative vs. imperative paradigms (e.g., functional vs. object-oriented programming).
- Design Patterns: Explain your most-used design patterns and their contexts.
- Agile Development: Understand Agile software development principles and share your perspective on them.
- Software Testing: Discuss your approach to software testing.
- Debugging: Describe how you tackled a difficult bug in a large application.
- Communication: Explain how you communicate technical challenges to non-technical stakeholders.
